# <div align="center">Fake Roblox Hits</div>


Fake Roblox Hits is a tool that allows you to send fake Roblox hits to a Discord webhook. Please note that this is for showcase purposes only, and we do not encourage or condone the use of this tool for malicious purposes.

To use the tool, all you need is the target user's ID, and you can send fake hits to their Roblox account. Please note that sometimes there may be an IP error, so you may need to rerun the tool.

This is a Flask project, and while we have done our best to minimize bugs, please keep in mind that this is our first Flask project, and some bugs may still exist.
